This course is based on managing threads and parallel processing. The thread management is done in fortran 90, so some of the holders contain .f90 files. The front end was done in python and so they show the implementation of the thread management. It is my regret that I don't have access to the file which provided the quesitons for which the code is the answer, and no write-up to give more context. However in the homeworks, the lecturer-provided and student-completed files are left, usually named 'hw_template' and 'hw_dev' respectively.
